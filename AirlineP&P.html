            <p>
                <b>Keep your record locator confidential: </b> <br> When you make a booking, you will be given a 6-character record locator, also known as a Passenger Name Record (PNR). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person
                in your booking. You should keep your record locator confidential, as giving it to others may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others and do not want them to have access to your booking
                details, you should have each person make their own bookings.
            </p>
            <h3>Data retention policyExpand</h3>
            <p>Your personal information will be retained only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, legal requirements and the duration of your use of
                our website and receipt of our Services.</p>
