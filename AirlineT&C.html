        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p id="a1">A Terms & Conditions document for a website is an agreement the website makes with its users about <span style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;">how to use the site properly,</span> as well as <span style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;">the obligations and responsibilities of each party.</span>            Websites, especially commercial websites, have a portion of the site devoted to Terms & Conditions because it's the most important document for <span style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;">letting site users know what is expected of them.</span>            For owners/operators running any kind of business or personal website that allows user interaction, it's a good idea to have a clearly laid out document with all the Terms & Conditions required.</p>
        <p id="a2">
            The Terms & Conditions document on any website creates a legally binding set of rules for the user, as well as, in most cases, the website owner. It's a place to set up expectations for each of the parties and <span style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;"> ensure that the use of the website runs smoothly for both.</span>

            <span style="color: black; font-weight: bolder;"> and the Information Technology Act, 2000. </span>
